## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, [STORY NAME](STORY URL)

## Load libraries

Loading required libraries for this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
options(scipen=999)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(refinr)
```

## Load and Cleaning Data

In this section, describe the source of the data, write a basic data dictionary for data you are working with, and discuss any caveats or issues you discovered working with this data. 

```{r}
# Load required data
 baltimore_homicide<- read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv")
# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

# Clean required data and prepare for analysis if needed. 


```

## Sentences to Engineer
In this notebook, we are reverse engineering five sentences from the story.

### Sentence 1

* **Sentence text**: City police made an arrest in 41 percent of homicides in 2014; last year (2018), the rate was just 27 percent, a 14 percentage point drop.
* **Analysis summary**: After the results of our analysis, the statistic that city police made an arrest in 41 percent of homicides in 2014 is correct. We attempted to analyze the 2018 statistic, only to find that the data frame doesn't include any data from 2018.

```{r}
#2014
baltimore_homicide %>% 
  filter(city == "Baltimore") %>%
  mutate(reported_date = as.Date(as.character( reported_date), format="%Y%m%d")) %>%
  filter(reported_date >= as.Date("2014-01-01"), reported_date <= as.Date("2014-12-31")) %>%
  group_by(disposition)%>%
   summarise(
    count= n()
  ) %>%
  mutate(s = sum(count)) %>%
  filter(disposition == "Closed by arrest") %>%
  mutate(c = sum(count)) %>%
  mutate(percentage = c / s) %>%
  select(percentage) %>%
  group_by(percentage) %>%
  slice(1:1)
#2018
baltimore_homicide %>% 
  filter(city == "Baltimore") %>%
  mutate(reported_date = as.Date(as.character( reported_date), format="%Y%m%d")) %>%
  filter(reported_date >= as.Date("2018-01-01"), reported_date <= as.Date("2018-12-31")) %>%
  group_by(disposition)%>%
   summarise(
    count= n()
  ) %>%
  mutate(s = sum(count)) %>%
  filter(disposition == "Closed by arrest") %>%
  mutate(c = sum(count)) %>%
  mutate(percentage = c / s) %>%
  select(percentage) %>%
  group_by(percentage) %>%
  slice(1:1)

```

### Sentence 2

* **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]
* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 4

* **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]
* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
